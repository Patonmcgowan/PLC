# PLC
A browser based emulation of a PLC 5/25.  Knowledge of ladder logic is required to configure the PLC logic in order to have a running PLC program (this app can also be used as a ladder logic tutor).

This project is written in vanilla Javascript, and is installed and run on a client system. Aside from a Javascript browser, all dependancies are included in the project (ie no need for Node.js, React, jQuery etc etc). This code will consequently require CORS Access-Control-Allow-Origin enabled to run.

Start by opening PLC.html in a browser window to run one emulated PLC, or index.html in a browser window to emulate two networked PLCs.

This is a running program but is still a work in progress, so not all features are complete. The code was developed for the Chrome browser under Microsoft Windows, so may render differently under other browsers. Limited testing has been completed under *nix and MacOS environments, with no real operability tests on the iOS environment for an iPhone and iPad.
